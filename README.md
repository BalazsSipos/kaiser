This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It is a website of a sport club.

The application is deployed and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

It will spin up a development server and start the app in development mode. It can be reached through [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:1234) in the browser.

The server will automatically restart and the page will reload if you make edits in the code.

### `npm run build`

Generates an optimized version of your application for production.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is compiled and browser bundles are minified.

### Additional scripts

- `npm run start`: Starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build` first.
- `npm run export`: Allows you to export your app to static HTML, which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for all files in the /src, /app, /pages, /components, and /lib directories.

## Deployment

The code is deployed and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
Every time there is a commit from an author included in the Vercel dev team, it will get deployed automatically.
The deployed links can be found in comments of commits and pull requests.
